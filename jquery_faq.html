    <dt>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"><p><a href="https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/fee-free-parks-state.htm">Fewer
        than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees</a>. You can obtain park entrance passes by visiting a
        park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park
        prior
        to your visit. (See the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm">park search</a> to locate a specific
        park.) There are a number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that
        offer
        entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military,
        Senior,
        4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes). Learn more about the <a

    <dt>What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible"><p>The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by the Secretary
        of
        the Interior
        on July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the National
        Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water
        representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself representing historical and
        archeological values. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/hfc/services/identity/identity-history.cfm"
        >Read
            more about the history of the arrowhead and other elements of NPS visual design</a>.

        The NPS allows limited use of the NPS arrowhead when doing so contributes to our work. <a
