    <dt>How do I obtain a park entrance pass?</dt>

        park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available; we recommend calling a park

        park.) There are a number of entrance passes available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that
        offer
        entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military,
        Senior,
        4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes). Learn more about the <a

    <dt>What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>

        of
        the Interior
        on July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the National
        Park System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water
        representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself representing historical and
        archeological values. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/hfc/services/identity/identity-history.cfm"

            more about the history of the arrowhead and other elements of NPS visual design</a>.

<div class="national-park-facts">
    <h3>Big Bend National Park Facts</h3>
    <ul id="big-bend">
        <li>The Rio Grande River serves both as the border of Big Bend National Park, as well as the international
            border between the United States and Mexico. Within the park, this covers a distance of 118 miles. A
            recently reopened border crossing at Boquillas allows park visitors to legally cross into Mexico.
        </li>
        <li>The name Big Bend comes from a large bend in the Rio Grande River along the park boundary.</li>
        <li>The large range of elevations in the park contribute to its biological diversity. There are 56 species of
            reptiles, 75 species of mammals, more than 450 species of birds, along with at least 1,200 species of
            plants. Caverns.
        </li>
        <li>The lowest elevation found in Big Bend is 1,715 feet at the Rio Grande River and the highest elevation found
            in Big Bend is 7,832 feet on Emory Peak.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Kenai Fjords National Park Facts</h3>
    <ul id="kenai-fjords">
        <li>On November 16, 1978, Kenai Fjords National Monument was created along with 15 others. On December 2, 1980,
            the monument was changed to a national park, along with all other Alaskan national parks, by the Alaska
            Native Interests Land Conservation Act.
        </li>
        <li>Kenai Fjords has a large variety of birds, especially along the coastal areas. Many people come here and
            take the cruises for the sole reason of bird watching. Puffins are particularly popular to look for.
        </li>
        <li>51% of the land in Kenai Fjords National Park is covered by ice.</li>
        <li>The Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster in 1989 in Prince William Sound had a large effect on Kenai Fjords. Oil
            can still be found on the coastline today.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Yosemite National Park Facts</h3>
    <ul id="yosemite">
        <li>Yosemite National Park took a few steps to reach its present form. On June 30, 1864, President Abraham
            Lincoln signed the bill creating the Yosemite Grant, given to the state of California to form Yosemite State
            Park. On October 1, 1890 Congress passed the bill creating Yosemite National Park, but California retained
            control of the valley and Mariposa Grove. Finally, in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the bill
            that took back the valley and Mariposa Grove and added it to the national park.
        </li>
        <li>Yosemite was the third most visited national park in 2013, behind only <a
                href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm">Grand Canyon</a> and <a
                href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm">Great Smoky Mountains</a>.
        </li>
        <li>The world famous Yosemite Valley, where most people spend their time, is only a tiny fraction of the park,
            less than 1% of the total area. Nearly 95% of the park has been designated as wilderness.
        </li>
        <li>Yosemite Valley is a classic glacier-cut valley, carved out of the solid granite. Glaciers in Yosemite
            Valley may have reached thicknesses of 4,000 feet or more.
